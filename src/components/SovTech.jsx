                  Reason i want to be a developer at SOVTECH is because SovTech is the leading custom software development company in South Africa and I want to work with the best.Sovtech is full of young people
                  and that make it easy for them to have a professional relationship together as young people and make it easy to adapt at a work environment and for me that's the kind of work environment i need right now as graduate.
                  I can relate to what the company values most when it comes to business areas (the people, the clients and business).It shows that technology is being used as business tool to change the world.
                  And Over the years Sovtech have produced great developers from their graduate programmes with the mission to design,build,deploy and maintain great custom sofware, I want to be one of them.
                  I want to grow and able to change together with Sovtech, as a graduate you should have room for growth and i believe I will be in a right place to do so.Getting in to Sovtech will be a great 
                  big step to my career and reaching my goal as Software Develper as i will be mentored by the best in the business and i believe that will help me to adapt fast and get things done.
                  I believe that next year is going to be my best year with SovTech,as i will be bringing positive impact to the company to help me secure a future at Sovtech and I'm ready to have fun and code with Sovtech.
